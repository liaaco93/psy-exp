A very barebones server that has some basic semblance of userpages, interface with a database, and an admin api.
To install and run:
-Ensure MongoDB, Node.js, and Coffeescript are installed
-$ cd psy-exp			//or wherever the files are
-$ npm install			//installs the dependencies in package.json
-$ coffee -c server.coffee	//converts server file to .js
-$ npm start			//starts up server on localhost:3000
